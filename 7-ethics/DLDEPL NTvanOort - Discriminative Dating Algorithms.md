# Discrimination in Dating Algorithms

For this assignment I will formulate my initial thoughts after reading the article about dating app Breeze and it’s discriminating algorithm.

## First impressions

I have read the article and honestly, I can only agree and commend Breeze for listening to their users and wanting to improve their app and underlying algorithms. This shows respect to their users. However, I do think Breeze is required to alter the algorithm in a way that they will be able to understand (exactly) how their algorithm works. This is part of their responsibility to the users of the app.

## Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

I decided to start creating the DAG (Figure 0.1 - DAG Breeze App) by modelling the general steps of the Breeze algorithm from input of the data to a match between two persons. Afterwards, I took a look at the ethical components which could be inferred from the article and tried to incorporate these into the DAG.

Trying to incorporate these steps helped me to think more about ethical components of technological applications throughout an entire process of development and post application go-live.

## Advise

My advise, to a data scientist who is involved in such a project, would be to carefully consider the ethical implications up front. When we’re dealing with bias, unfair treatment, or other equally heavy ethical harms, we’re dealing with them on an individual level as well which could emotionally damage the involved individual.
