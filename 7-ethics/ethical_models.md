# Ethical Models

For this assignment I will be comparing two models, which will be compared to find differences and similarities. Furthermore, I will elaborate on which model I prefer and why. This assignment will be completed by focusing on which model I think suits data ethics best.

## Models

Since we’re discussing ethics in relation to data and technology, I decided to stick to ethical models in that domain. This let me encounter several, such as:

- Technology Impact Cycle Tool (TICT)
- Value-Sensitive Design (VSD)
- AI Ethics Maturity Model
- IEEE Ethically Aligned Design Framework

For the deep dive I will focus on **TICT** and **VSD** as these have a clear distinction between them.

## Technology Impact Cycle Tool (TICT)

The TICT is designed by Fontys in 2019 to enable creators of any kind to ask themselves and think deeply about the consequences of their new technological application in relation to several perspectives, like society (Fontys, z.d.). This framework is focused on evaluation, meaning to consider the consequences of the new tech.

## Value-Sensitive Design (VSD)

VSD is quite the opposite of TICT in terms of the timing in which the ethical and moral side is integrated. Where TICT is centered on afterwards evaluation, VSD aims to let creators think carefully about the impact of the deliverable at the start and throughout the development. Taking into account people’s values with a focus on ethics and morality (Gerdes & Frandsen, 2023).

## Preference

Whilst both models encourage to think deeply about the choices being made in the development of new technologies, I believe it is not too easy to choose one model over the other in terms of which one is better suited for data ethics. Because I think the models should both be used in different situations.

As innovation is as unstoppable as ever, and with technology improving faster and faster, I think that the VSD model should be applied mainly when an entirely new technology is emerging. As this is uncharted territory for everybody, nobody knows the full extent of potential problems it brings along. Because one thing is certain, innovation is paired with new problems.

With competition all around us, new technologies will be tested and improved upon and I think that at this point it is suited to use the TICT for evaluating the slightly different solution as it has a foundation from the totally new innovation and thus the problems that arise should already be known. Therefore, it should be relatively easier to try and evaluate afterwards.
